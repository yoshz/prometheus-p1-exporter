# prometheus p1 exporter

The prometheus p1 exporter is a simple (by design and purpose) binary that can read data from a smart meter through a serial port and expose these metrics to be scraped by prometheus.

## configuration

The only things that can be configured with an environment var is:
 - **SERIAL_DEVICE**: the device that needs to be read (usually something like /dev/ttyUSB0)


## limitations

Lines are processed as they come in, no checksums are handled.

For now, only a few fields are exported:

- power used in tariff 1 in Wh
- power used in tariff 2 in Wh
- current power draw in W
- gas used in cm2, updated hourly

These values come from the following oids:

- 1-0:1.8.1 (meter reading, tariff 1 in kWh)
- 1-0:2.8.2 (meter reading, tariff 2 in kWh)
- 1-0:1.7.0 (Actual power delivered in kW)
- 0-1:24.2.1 (gas meter reading, includes timestamp of reading)
